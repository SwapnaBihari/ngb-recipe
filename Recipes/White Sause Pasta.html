    <h2><u><i>Description</i></u> :-</h2>
    <p><ul><li><b>White Sauce also known as Bechamel Sauce has its origin from the Italian & French Cuisines. In classic culinary terms, this is what is known as a mother sauce. 
        It is the base for many other sauces and it offers a great deal of flexibility to your repertoire of recipes.</b></li></ul></p>
    <h2><u><i>Ingredients</i></u> :-</h2>
    <p><b>
        • 1 cup (100 grams) pasta (penne or macaroni)<br/>
        • 11/2 cup milk (full fat or plant milk)<br/>
        • 2 tablespoons butter + 1/2 tablespoon oil or butter (to sauté veggies)<br/>
        • 1/4 cup heavy cream or 2 to 3 tablespoons cheese (optio nal, parmesan, cream cheese, mozzarella or cheddar)<br/>
        • 1/2 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br/>
        • 1/4 teaspoon black pepper (crushed or ground, adjust to taste)<br/>
        • 2 garlic cloves grated (optional, can use 1 teaspoon to tablespoon as per preference)<br/>
    </b></p>
    <h2><u><i>Instructions</i></u> :-</h2>
    <p><b>
        <u>Boil Pasta:</u><br/><br/>
        1. Bring 4 cups of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add pasta and 1/4 teaspoon salt.<br/>
        2. Cook on a medium high flame till al dente. Check the instructions on the pasta package for the correct cook time. Check them a minute earlier than mentioned on the package. They must be tender, firm and chewy but not mushy.
         Mine takes about 9 mins.<br/>
        3. Reserve about 1/4 cup pasta cooked stock.<br/>
        4. Drain the pasta to a colander. Cover and keep aside.<br/>
        5. Pour 1/2 tbsp oil or butter to a pan. Add the vegetables and sauté them on a medium high heat until slightly tender yet crunchy. 
        This takes me about 5 to 6 mins. Remove to a plate and set aside.<br/><br/>

        <u>Make White Sause Pasta:</u><br/><br/>
        1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and add minced garlic (optional) and fry for 30 to 40 seconds on a medium heat.<br/>
        2. Stir in all-purpose flour.<br/>
        3. Saute well until the flour loses the raw smell, for about a minute. Don't brown the flour. Since this is a small quantity, the roux can become dry and clumpy. It's just fine.
         Turn off the stove/heat and slowly pour 1/2 cup milk while you stir to incorporate the milk into the roux<br/>
        4. Keep whisking till it looks creamy & uniform to prevent forming lumps. Pour the rest of the milk and stir well.<br/>
        5. Turn on the heat and cook on a medium-low until the white sauce becomes thick. Keep stirring/whisking & scrape the sides for a uniform sauce through out.<br/>
        6. Pour the heavy cream or cheese and mix well.<br/>
        5. The white sauce is done perfectly when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Alternately you can draw a finger/line through the coated spoon. The sauce should wipe clean and leave a space, meaning it is thick enough.<br/>
        6. Add the vegetables and the cooked pasta & mix well.<br/>
        7. Add pepper, oregano (or mixed Italian herbs) and chili flakes. You can also add a pinch of ground nutmeg if you want. If the sauce looks too thick (as it cools down), add 2 tbsps of the reserved stock so the sauce loosens a bit.<br/>
        8. Garnish white sauce pasta with red chilli flakes and crushed black pepper. Serve it hot or warm as the sauce thickens more when it cools down.<br/>
